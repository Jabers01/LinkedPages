<p>Reaching over $73 million in box office sales in the United States, Arrival was a suprise science-fiction hit that seemed to comne out of no where. Directed by Denis Villeneuve,who is also set to direct Blade Runner II and directed the FBI hit Sicario, Arrival is a testament to science fiction fans that alien movies can vary in plot dramatically and still be successful. Arrival is a story about alien spaceships touching down on the earth, and once confused by the aliens' communication, linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is hired to make sense of the aliens' language. It is up to Banks to solve this mystery, before humanity plunges into war, and quite possibly into extinction. </p>
